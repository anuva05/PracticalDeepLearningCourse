# PracticalDeepLearningCourse
This repo contains my Fast.ai course notes from the online Practical Deep Learning for Coders course.
Includes Jupyter notebooks with various examples from the course tried out by me  using the fast.ai library (built on top of Pytorch).
The intention of trying out these examples was to get familiar with various DL models and concepts.
